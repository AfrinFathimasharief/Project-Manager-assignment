Title: Container Image Vulnerability Scanner Dashboard
Objective:
Help DevOps teams or security engineers identify, prioritize, and take action on vulnerabilities in thousands of container images stored in their repositories.

User Personas:
DevOps Engineer

Needs quick visibility on which container images are vulnerable.

Wants to prioritize based on severity and frequency.

Security Analyst

Needs detailed insights and vulnerability context.

Tracks trends, compliance, and reports across images.

Core User Problems:
It's hard to identify which container images are vulnerable among thousands.

There's no clear way to prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

Manual review of each image is time-consuming.

Developers need actionable insights to fix vulnerabilities efficiently.
